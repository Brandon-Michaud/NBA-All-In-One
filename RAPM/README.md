# RAPM
This directory handles calculating regularized adjusted plus-minus (RAPM) using possession data.
The code is borrowed from [Ryan Davis' GitHub tutorial](https://github.com/rd11490/NBA_Tutorials), but I restructured it some to fit my liking.
I also added helpful comments explaining what each piece of code does.
All code can be found in [`rapm.py`](rapm.py).
I have added options to calculate the RAPM for ranges of seasons or dates, as well as for any arbitrary possession data.
